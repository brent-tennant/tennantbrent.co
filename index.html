          <h2>About me.</h2>
          <div class="half-width">
            <p>I've been residing in Portland, OR for the past two years striving to obtain a career in the tech industry. I was fortunate to receive exposure
            to the tech world while working as a Lead Service Technician-a job that required a high attention to detail and a whole lot of problem solving.
            While selling was also a major aspect to the job, I yearned for helping others and solving the puzzles of the problems laid before me.

          <div class="half-width">
            <p>This general interest led to my pursuit to understanding the interworkings of what connects humanity and the world as a whole.
              After teaching myself some basic programming languages, I decided that now is the time to dive in, enroll into <a href="http://skillcrush.com"> Skillcrush</a>
              and take the leap to starting a career with web development in mind.</p>

            <h3>Hand-Coded HTML</h3>
            <p>My focus is writing clean, well-formatted, semantic HTML5 by hand
              to make sure that the content is easy to read, easy to collaborate,
              trouble-shoot and accessible.</p>

            <h3>Well-Organized CSS</h3>
            <p>I pride myself on writing CSS that is easy to read and build on.
              I focus on keeping my CSS lean and fast to load, and I make it a
              habit to stay up to date on current best practices.</p>

            <h3>Ease Converting Designs into Code</h3>
            <p>You can trust me to take a designer's PSD and quickly &amp;
               accurately convert it into a webpage that is pixel-perfect match.</p>
